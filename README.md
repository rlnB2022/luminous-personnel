# Project Title

Luminous Personnel - a staffing agency company website

# Project Description

A startup job-placement company reached out to me to create an online prescence.

# Technologies Used

This project was created with the following tech:

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript
* SCSS

# Problems Faced

The main difficulty with this project was the timeframe needed to complete, along with a minimal understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was also my first paid gig. So, I was under pressure to produce a website for their company that they felt was adequate.

# Solutions / What I learned

Since I was very new to front-end development, I utilized Google, StackOverflow and the MDN Web documentation. Not only did I solve the problems I ran across, I was able to learn along the way. A year later (2020) and I have reworked the website to be mobile-friendly first.

# Takeaways

For my first paid project, I am very proud of the effort I gave. I'm also very thankful for the opportunity to create something that the world can use.
